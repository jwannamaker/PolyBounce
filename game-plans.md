# General Game Ideas
- The color of the ball matches the color of the side of the ring that you need to hit in order to move on to the next ring.
- **W** to move to next outer ring
- **S** to move to next inner ring
- **A** to rotate the current ring ccw
- **D** to rotate the current ring cw
- **Space** to 'jump' the ball
- **Shift** to 'slow' the ball (nearly freeze in place but not quite)
